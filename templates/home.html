            <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:1.05em;">
                I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, specializing in monetary theory,
            monetary policy, and the political economy of central banking. My dissertation, 
            <em>The First to Spend: The Redistributive Politics of Central Banking</em>, examines how special 
            interests influence monetary authorities to direct new money and credit toward politically favored 
            groups, producing what economists call Cantillon Effects. Through historical case studies‚Äîincluding 
            the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Reichsbank‚ÄîI analyze the institutional, political, 
            and economic mechanisms that drive redistributive outcomes in monetary policy.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:1.05em;">
                My research agenda bridges Austrian economics, public choice theory, and monetary history, with a 
            strong emphasis on institutional analysis. I draw on archival sources, historical narratives, and 
            comparative case studies to understand how monetary institutions evolve under political pressure and 
            how discretionary policy can entrench economic privilege.
            </p>
            <p style="line-height:1.6; font-size:1.05em;">
                I view education as an opportunity to cultivate analytical thinking and intellectual curiosity by 
            linking core theoretical concepts to historical episodes and real-world policy debates. My approach 
            emphasizes active engagement, encouraging students to work through problems, interpret historical 
            data, and debate policy implications in light of competing schools of thought. I aim to make the 
            classroom a space where students develop not only technical competence but also the ability to 
            critically assess how institutions shape economic outcomes. By integrating empirical evidence, 
            primary historical sources, and clear economic reasoning, I equip students to think as independent 
            economists who can apply their knowledge beyond the classroom.
            </p>
