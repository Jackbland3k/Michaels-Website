      <h1>Welcome,</h1>

      <p>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, specializing in monetary theory,
        monetary policy, and the political economy of central banking. My dissertation,
        <em>The First to Spend: The Redistributive Politics of Central Banking</em>, examines how special
        interests influence monetary authorities to direct new money and credit toward politically favored
        groups, producing what economists call Cantillon Effects. Through historical case studies‚Äîincluding
        the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, and the Reichsbank‚ÄîI analyze the institutional, political,
        and economic mechanisms that drive redistributive outcomes in monetary policy.
      </p>

        My research agenda bridges Austrian economics, public choice theory, and monetary history, with a
        strong emphasis on institutional analysis. I draw on archival sources, historical narratives, and
        comparative case studies to understand how monetary institutions evolve under political pressure and
        how discretionary policy can entrench economic privilege.

        I view education as an opportunity to cultivate analytical thinking and intellectual curiosity by
        linking core theoretical concepts to historical episodes and real-world policy debates. My approach
        emphasizes active engagement, encouraging students to work through problems, interpret historical
        data, and debate policy implications in light of competing schools of thought. I aim to make the
        classroom a space where students develop not only technical competence but also the ability to
        critically assess how institutions shape economic outcomes. By integrating empirical evidence,
        primary historical sources, and clear economic reasoning, I equip students to think as independent
        economists who can apply their knowledge beyond the classroom.
